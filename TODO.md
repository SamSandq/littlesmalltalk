# To Do

- Build a StringTemplate class that uses something like a subset of Mustache.
  - Must include looping constructs, #do: on collections.
  - Must include conditional constructs.
  - Build with #new: taking a String.
  - Render with #render: taking a Dictionary?
- Refactor all HTML building classes to use StringTemplate.
- UI improvements
  - Add toggle to display classes alphabetically or by hierarchy.
